# ttt — Test-Time Training for CORAL

This module integrates CORAL with [rLLM](https://github.com/rllm-org/rllm) to enable test-time training (TTT). CORAL is treated as a monolithic agent environment: the RL training loop spawns CORAL agents, collects the LLM call traces they produce, and uses score improvement as the reward signal.

## Architecture

```

## How it works

### 1. Trainer (`trainer.py`)

The entrypoint. Uses Hydra to load rLLM's unified config and accepts a CORAL `task.yaml` path via `+task_yaml=...`.

- Loads the task YAML and creates a repeated `Dataset` from its `task` section (the dataset is just the same task config repeated — CORAL agents work on the same task across all training steps).
- Sets defaults: `total_epochs=9999` (effectively infinite), `train_batch_size=1`, `val_batch_size=1`.
- Wires the `task_yaml` path into the generator module's `_coral_state` so the generator knows which config to pass to `coral start`.
- Creates an rLLM `AgentTrainer` with the tinker backend, passing the generator and evaluator.

### 2. Generator (`generator.py`)

The generator is an `@rllm.rollout`-decorated function called once per training step. Instead of making direct LLM calls, it orchestrates a full CORAL agent run:

**On-policy routing:**

Before starting or resuming agents, the generator writes a `.litellm_rllm.yaml` config that routes CORAL's gateway to `config.base_url` — the rLLM inference server serving the current policy weights. This is passed as a CORAL CLI override (`agents.gateway.config=...`). The request chain becomes:

```
CORAL agent → CORAL gateway (logs traces) → rLLM inference server (on-policy model)
```

If `config.base_url` is empty (e.g. standalone testing), the generator falls back to whatever upstream is defined in the task YAML's original `litellm_config.yaml`.

**First call — `coral start`:**
1. Generates the on-policy gateway config from `config.base_url`.
2. Launches `coral start --config task.yaml run.session=local agents.gateway.config=...` as a background subprocess.
3. Discovers the `.coral` directory by reading `results_dir` and `task.name` from the YAML, then following the `latest` symlink.
4. Initializes tracking state: `seen_hashes` (set of processed attempt commit hashes), `trace_offset` (line offset into the gateway JSONL).

**Subsequent calls — `coral resume`:**
1. Regenerates the on-policy gateway config (in case `config.base_url` changed).
2. Launches `coral resume --task <slug> run.session=local agents.gateway.config=...` as a background subprocess.
3. Agents resume from their saved sessions (Claude Code session IDs persisted in `.coral/public/sessions.json`).

**Every call then:**
1. **Polls for N new evals** — watches `.coral/public/attempts/` for new `<commit_hash>.json` files not in `seen_hashes`. Configurable via `N_EVALS` (default: 1). Polls every 5 seconds with a 600-second timeout.
2. **Stops agents** — runs `coral stop`, which sends SIGTERM to the manager process. This gracefully shuts down agents and saves their sessions for the next resume.
3. **Reads new attempts** — loads the attempt JSON files for the new commit hashes, which contain `score`, `parent_hash`, `agent_id`, `status`, etc.
4. **Collects gateway traces** — reads new lines from `.coral/public/gateway/requests.jsonl` (incremental, starting from `trace_offset`). Each JSONL entry contains a full LLM request/response pair logged by CORAL's gateway middleware.
5. **Converts to rllm Trajectories** — groups JSONL entries by `agent_id`. Each entry becomes an rllm `Step` with `chat_completions` (the request messages + assistant response), `model_response`, and `action` fields. Steps are grouped into `Trajectory` objects (one per agent).
6. **Returns an `Episode`** with the trajectories and metadata (`coral_dir`, `new_commit_hashes`, `new_attempts`).

An `atexit` handler ensures `coral stop` is called if the training process exits unexpectedly.

### 3. Evaluator (`evaluator.py`)

The evaluator is an `@rllm.evaluator`-decorated function that computes the RL reward from CORAL's eval results.

**Reward signal: score improvement over parent commit.**

For the latest attempt in this training step:
1. Reads `score` from the attempt dict.
2. Reads `parent_hash` and looks up the parent attempt's JSON file at `.coral/public/attempts/<parent_hash>.json`.
3. Computes `improvement = score - parent_score`.
4. If no parent exists (first attempt), `parent_score` defaults to 0.

This reward structure incentivizes the agent to make changes that improve the eval score relative to the previous commit, rather than rewarding absolute score (which could lead to reward hacking).

The evaluator assigns the improvement as `traj.reward` on every trajectory in the episode and emits `latest_score` and `improvement` as signals for logging.
